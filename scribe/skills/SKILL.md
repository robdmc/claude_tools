name: scribe
description: Maintains a narrative log of exploratory work with file archives. Capabilities: (1) Log entries with propose-confirm flow, (2) Archive files linked to entries, (3) Restore archived files, (4) Query past work by time or topic, (5) Link related entries for thread tracking. Activates when user addresses "scribe" directly (e.g., "hey scribe, log this", "scribe, save this notebook", "scribe, what did we try yesterday?") or uses `/scribe` commands.

# Scribe

The scribe maintains a narrative log of your exploratory work and can archive important files.

**Address naturally:** "hey scribe, log this" / "scribe, save this notebook" / "scribe, what did we try yesterday?"

**Or use commands:** `/scribe` / `/scribe save file.py` / `/scribe ask what happened last week?`

## Quick Reference

| Mode | Trigger | Action |
|------|---------|--------|
| Log | "scribe, log this" | Propose entry → confirm → write |
| Quick log | "scribe, quick log: fixed bug" | Write directly |
| Archive | "scribe, save notebook.ipynb" | Log + archive file |
| Restore | "scribe, restore the ETL script" | Copy from assets |
| Query | "scribe, what did we try?" | Search and summarize |

## Directory Structure

```
.scribe/
├── 2026-01-23.md      # Daily log files
└── assets/            # Archived files
    └── 2026-01-23-14-35-notebook.ipynb
```

## Scripts

Scripts in `{SKILL_DIR}/scripts/`. Resolve `{SKILL_DIR}` to the directory containing this SKILL.md file.

| Script | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `entry.py write --file /tmp/scribe_entry_${CLAUDE_SESSION_ID}.md` | Write entry from temp file |
| `entry.py new-id` | Generate entry ID for current time (handles collisions) |
| `entry.py last` | Get last entry ID from today |
| `assets.py save <id> <file>` | Archive a file |
| `assets.py list [filter]` | List archived files |
| `assets.py get <asset> --dest <dir>` | Restore a file |
| `validate.py` | Check for errors |

**Python 3.9+ required.** Use `python3` if `python` doesn't point to Python 3 on your system.

## Logging Flow (Task Instructions)

Follow these steps when logging:

1. **Assess** — Check conversation context, recent logs, `git status`
2. **Propose** — Draft entry, offer optional file archives
3. **Confirm** — Wait for user approval
4. **Write** — Create draft at `/tmp/scribe_entry_${CLAUDE_SESSION_ID}.md` (always overwrite, never edit), then run `python {SKILL_DIR}/scripts/entry.py write --file /tmp/scribe_entry_${CLAUDE_SESSION_ID}.md`

**Shortcut:** For "quick log", write directly without proposing.

### Entry Format

Always create a fresh draft file (overwrite any existing) at `/tmp/scribe_entry_${CLAUDE_SESSION_ID}.md`:
```markdown
## Brief title here

What happened, why, what was tried.

**Files touched:**
- `file.py` — What changed

**Status:** Current state

---
```

The script adds timestamp and ID automatically.

## Entry IDs

Format: `YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM` (e.g., `2026-01-23-14-35`). Collisions get `-02`, `-03` suffix.

IDs link entries to assets and enable **Related** cross-references:
```markdown
**Related:** 2026-01-23-14-35 — Previous entry title
```

## Archiving

When archiving files, include the **Archived** section in your draft before writing. The asset filename is predictable: `{entry-id}-{filename}`.

1. Get entry ID — `python {SKILL_DIR}/scripts/entry.py new-id` (handles collisions)
2. Draft entry with **Archived** section using that ID
3. Write entry — `python {SKILL_DIR}/scripts/entry.py write --file /tmp/scribe_entry_${CLAUDE_SESSION_ID}.md`
4. Archive files — `python {SKILL_DIR}/scripts/assets.py save <id> <file>`

Example **Archived** section:
```markdown
**Archived:**
- `src/notebook.ipynb` → [`2026-01-23-14-35-notebook.ipynb`](assets/2026-01-23-14-35-notebook.ipynb)
```

## Querying

- **Time-based:** Read `.scribe/YYYY-MM-DD.md` directly
- **Topic-based:** `Grep` in `.scribe/`, then Read matches
- **Assets:** `python {SKILL_DIR}/scripts/assets.py list [filter]`

## Orientation (New Sessions)

1. Read today's log file
2. Run `git status` to see changes
3. Ask user what to capture

## Initialization

On first use, check if `.scribe/` exists. If not:
```bash
mkdir -p .scribe/assets
```

Then ensure `.gitignore` contains these entries (add if missing):
```
.scribe/
_20*-*
```

## Error Handling

- **No `.scribe/` directory**: Run initialization first
- **Script fails**: Show error output to user, don't retry automatically
- **Asset not found**: List available assets with `assets.py list`

## Reference Files

For detailed examples and edge cases, see:
- [references/logging.md](references/logging.md) — Entry formats, examples
- [references/archiving.md](references/archiving.md) — Archive/restore details
- [references/querying.md](references/querying.md) — Query patterns
- [references/recovery.md](references/recovery.md) — Error recovery, edit commands

## Principles

- **Narrator, not stenographer** — Write prose, not dumps
- **Capture the why** — Not just what, but why it was tried
- **Stay concise** — Entries should be scannable
- **Preserve dead ends** — Failed approaches prevent repeats
