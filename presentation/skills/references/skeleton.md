# Skeleton Template

When `/presentation <filename>` is called and the file does not exist, create the file with this content (replacing "My Presentation" with a sensible title based on the filename, if possible).

This structure is also the target format for PPTX/PDF extraction — when extracting from binary files, the content is mapped into this same skeleton layout so it works with both spec refinement and direct build.

```markdown
# My Presentation

## Purpose
What is this presentation about? What should the audience take away?

## Audience
Who is this for? What's their level of familiarity with the topic?

## Slides

### Title Slide
- Title and subtitle
- One-liner summary

### Slide Title
Description of what this slide should show — key points, data, diagrams, or visuals.

### Another Slide
More content. Include as much detail as you want — diagram layouts, specific numbers,
color preferences, chart descriptions. The more detail, the better the output.

### Summary
- Key takeaways
- Next steps or call to action

## Style Notes (optional)
Any preferences for colors, visual style, text density, or diagram approach.
